## Implementation Knowledge Added

These agents have been enhanced with practical experience from the AnwaltsAI Legal Clipboard and Clause Library implementation, including:

### Technical Patterns Learned:
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Custom events (`legal-copy`) for decoupled component communication
- **Modal System Design**: Glassmorphic modals with proper overlay management and accessibility
- **Clipboard Integration**: Browser API usage with fallback mechanisms for older browsers
- **SessionStorage Persistence**: Data management with proper serialization and error handling
- **Search & Filter Systems**: Real-time filtering with case-insensitive matching
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with user feedback and error handling
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Template-based HTML generation with proper escaping
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Component Lifecycle**: Proper initialization, cleanup, and state management

### Problem-Solving Experience:
- **Integration Debugging**: Fixed missing function calls and event handler setup
- **UI/UX Consistency**: Maintained design language across new components
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Implemented fallback mechanisms for API support
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Code Organization**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Development Workflow Knowledge:
- **Git Integration**: Proper commit messages and branch management
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Building features that work without JavaScript
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **Testing Strategies**: Manual testing approaches and validation techniques

## Usage Instructions

1. **Create each agent** by copying the command and using it in Claude
2. **Delete this file** after agent creation: `rm "BMAD-Agents-Enhanced.md"`
3. **Test agents** by invoking them with specific BMAD-METHOD tasks
4. **Use together** - these agents are designed to work as a coordinated team
